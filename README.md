## Inferring individual-specific transcription factor activity
Scripts used for the first step can be found in the folder `TF_activity_inference`   
Tutorial: [link](TF_activity_inference/README.md)

## Mapping genetic determinants of TF activity (aQTLs)
Scripts used for the second step can be found in the folder `aQTL_mapping`
